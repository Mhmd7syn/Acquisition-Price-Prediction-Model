# Project Description Acquisition Price Prediction Model  

Objective  
Develop a machine learning model to predict acquisition deal prices using historical M&A data, including company profiles, financials, deal terms, and market trends.  

Data Features Used  
- Company Attributes (IPO status, funding, employees, industry)  
- Deal Terms (cashstock, status, year)  
- Market & Financials (total funding, acquisitions history)  
- Geographic & Temporal Factors (location, announcement year)  

Methodology  
1. Data Preprocessing Clean and normalize structuredunstructured data (e.g., news, profiles).  
2. Feature Engineering Extract key predictors (e.g., revenue multiples, growth metrics).  
3. Model Training Test regression algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks).  
4. Deployment API integration for real-time price estimation.  

Outcome  
A tool for investors and analysts to estimate fair acquisition values based on comparable deals and company fundamentals.
